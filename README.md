How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The hard part is connecting what the user says to actionable directions for the development teams. Sometimes this comes in the form of asking the users
a fe 'why' questions to get to the bottom of what they want to be able to do and see with the product. Then you have to sit an put the user story together
to describe what the user wants and how it will look/ determine the priority of that component. Not every product should incude everything that the customer wants.
If what they want is outside the purpose of the product or doesn't align with the message or direction of the company then this also has to be taken into account.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Deloping programs is just a giant puzzle in how to deliver value to the customer. There has to be a problem that we are looking to solve and do so in the most
streamlined and effiecient mannor. I have long been of the opinion that the most important things are how easy is it for a customer to interact with my product, how
good is my customer service, and how efficiently do we solve the problem. If you provide a quick service that provides value, is easy for the customer to pay for, and 
provide excellent service, then there is no way you can fail. I plan to implement many of the Agile principles into my future work. The daily Scrums are such a great way to keep 
everyone excited about the project and on task/ identify any issues quickly. Also, I am best working in an atmoshphere that enhances and embraces the ability to change and figure things out.
I learned a long time ago that my best ability is identifying and implementing adjustments as new problems arise. Nothing can ever fully be planned as there will always
be issues that you can't see beforehand. The ability to identify issues and correct them is what truly makes endevours successful.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means providing value to the team each day. This can come in a number of forms. One is to make sure that you do the best work you can do
when assigned a task. Completing a task quickly and correctly will go a long way for the team. Also, helping others complete tasks by sharing your knowledge or experience with them.
The team is only as strong as the weakest link so everyone should try to elevate each other. Also, bringing a positive outlook and excitement to the team. Being a coach and an
athlete has taught me how important mindset and attitude is for a team. I believe that everyone and every team can be better and reach levels that they can't even currently imagine.
Given a long enough timeline, effort, and a growth mindset, we are able to achieve amazing things. Lastly, I just beleive in the value of hard work. I don't think that work should be everything, but working hard
and taking pride in what you produce will always lead to better results.
